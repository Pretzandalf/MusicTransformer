album review: 
Dad music but good
REVIEW REPOST #078. I repost my old reviews, which got no attention, with updated thoughts. Posted this review over a year ago, but I'm posting it again.

In celebration of Metallica's new record that's on the way, why not review one of the greatest and most iconic Metal albums of all time? That of course is Master Of Puppets by Metallica.

Metallica is my Dad's third favorite band after Pink Floyd and Faith No More, which he played me all since I was a little kid. I remember the first time he played me the title track here, I was a little older, maybe like 9 or 10, and holy shit I thought it was the heaviest darkest song ever. And I quickly got hooked, I mean this album is just straight-up iconic, and for a good reason. I'm also proud he went to a Metallica concert when they were in Slovakia in the 90s, that's cool to know he experienced that. The tracklist is just classics after classics, extremely well-constructed, forward-thinking, boundary-pushing Thrash Metal, with a lot of melodies yet a lot of aggression, while also providing musical complexity and fantastic guitar playing combined with incredible vocal dynamics and lyrics. I mean it's pretty much flawless. Also, the cover art is one of the most iconic covers ever. I love it, it matches the album so well.

Front to back, this thing doesn't disappoint. Every single song is so sharp around the edges, every single second and moment feels necessary and like it was carefully constructed. God knows what would Metal look like nowadays if this album never dropped. It would probably be dead. This thing and Ride The Lightning changed the whole landscape of Metal by taking these songs and pushing them to a completely another level with a perfect balance of energetic songs, power ballads, and more progressive cuts. The variety in this tracklist is just fantastic, and I'll get into the specific tracks in a second, but you can really see how this thing was put together perfectly like a Jigsaw falling into place (no Radiohead reference lol).

Not a single weak moment on this record. It is a classic for a reason, and I'm glad I've been exposed to it so young, it really shaped a lot of my taste. There are a few select albums and artists/bands that I was exposed to very young that shaped my taste forever (Abbey Road, DSOTM, Dan Barta Entropicture, Getz/Gilberto and Miles Davis, and of course MOP by Metallica, but that was a little bit later on). There are more but those are the main ones.

MOP really flies by like it's 15 minutes while the actual length is 54 minutes, because the quality is just so insanely engaging all the way through. Let's get into the specific tracks now.

Battery is the most perfect way to open up this album, I mean you start with these beautiful guitars that sound absolutely incredible and almost give off almost like a Flamingo vibe, that sets up the track perfectly, and then it transitions you into the heaviness. The guitars and vocals bring so much energy, momentum, pace, and drive to this song, it's insane. It moves so fast, it's hard to catch up. The whole track is 5 minutes, but it feels like 2. So many awesome things happening at once, with the most perfect song structure ever and great lyrics, how better to open up this album?

Master Of Puppets (title track), where do I even start with this one? I mean that riff is probably the most legendary and iconic Metal/Rock riff to ever exist. It's so legendary, because it's just that incredible, literally addicting to listen to that riff all these years later. And not only the beginning riff, but the guitars throughout the whole song are just incredible and super engaging, there's not one weak part of a riff, no no, it all feels sharp and every single passage is fantastic. I can play the beginning riff myself, but then when It gets to the spider riff, it gets very difficult lol, I still can't quite get that one. And then obviously the vocals and lyrics are just beyond iconic. Still wows me to this day.

The Thing That Should Not Be is the third track here, and there's not much to say about this one except that, it goes SO HARD and is probably the heaviest song here. So heavy, I absolutely love the chunky chugging guitar just penetrating my ears. One of the best songs here tbh.

Welcome Home (Sanitarium) is the perfect track to follow The Thing That Should Not Be, after such an energetic heavy banger, we kinda get a more ballady song here. Now, it's a little bit of a stretch to call this whole song a ballad, but still, it is softer, especially in the beginning. The vocals are absolutely wonderful in this song, my favorite part. Love it, it's perfect.

Disposable Heroes is very much an album track, and I don't have much to say about it. It's amazing and perfect, especially in the vocal department, but it's not the most stand-out song here.

Leper Messiah is hands down the most underrated song on this album and is in my top 3. That riff is absolutely incredible, I can't believe people don't talk about it more. James' vocal performance is absolutely chilling with how energetic and dark it is. One of the heaviest songs they have put out for sure and it's one of my favs from Metallica ever.

Orion is next and wow this song is special. It's definitely the most progressive song here alongside the title track, and it has some of the most fascinating guitar riffs I've ever heard. It starts off very rhythmic with a great riff, yet easily what makes this song so amazing for me is the riff at 1:40 after the build-up. Wow, that riff combined with the drums has to be one of the greatest things I've ever heard. Such an amazing fantastic riff, top 10 riffs of all time, the lead guitar is just absolutely beautiful in combination with the rhythm there. The rest of the song is fantastic, but that's what made me love this song so much the most.

Damage Inc. is the closing track here and it packs a lot of energy to close it out. I think Orion would work better as a closer, but this still works. My least favorite song on the album, the one I come back to the least, it doesn't stand out much at all from the other songs and doesn't work incredibly as a closer, yet it's still a perfect album track with great riffs and vocals.

So yeah that's pretty much how I feel. A timeless, groundbreaking, incredible masterpiece that changed the landscape of not only Metal, but Music in general, forever. Iconic and deserving of a 100.
